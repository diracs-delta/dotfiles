Here are my configuration files, managed by `yadm`. Below is a short description of my dotfiles and what I use them for.

## dependencies

* `st` -- terminal emulator (will put my build on github someday)

* `zsh` -- interactive shell

* `i3` -- window manager

* `compton` -- X compositor (provides terminal transparency)

* `pywal` -- colorscheme generator

* my `scripts` repository

## applications

* `zathura` -- PDF/EPUB/DJVU reader (try `^R` to see why)

* `ranger` -- file manager (until I finally get rid of this slow Python nonsense and get better at bash scripting and the `zsh` interface)

* `mpv` -- video player

* `youtube-dl` -- video downloader

* `ncmpcpp` -- music player, frontend for `mpd`

* `newsboat` -- RSS feed aggregator

* `vim` -- text editor

* `vimb` -- alternative web browser to firefox

## to-do

* get rid of `ranger` and make a terminal-based workflow

	* implement a preview system similar to `scope.sh`

* implement HTTPS-only config in `vimb`
